  %p.description
    The groups section allows the administrator to map many conditions from ClinicalTrials.gov or Oncore into a single grouping which is displayed in the categories section of the site.  The idea is that groups would make it easier for the public to navigate through many different conditions within a single area of study.

    %p Note: When changing groups the trials must be re-indexed to reflect the changes. This process can take up to 5 min to complete.  If you have made changes to the groups, please re-index by pressing the button below.
